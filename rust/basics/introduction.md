# Introduction to Rust

Rust is a modern systems programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency. It achieves memory safety without using garbage collection, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.

## Why Rust?

* **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system guarantees memory safety without a garbage collector
* **Performance**: Rust is as fast as C and C++
* **Concurrency**: Safe concurrency with compile-time guarantees
* **Zero-cost Abstractions**: High-level features that compile to efficient machine code
* **Modern Tooling**: Excellent package manager (Cargo) and compiler with helpful error messages

## Key Features

### 1. Ownership System
Rust's unique ownership system ensures memory safety and prevents common bugs like:
- Use after free
- Double free
- Null pointer dereferences
- Data races

### 2. Pattern Matching
Powerful pattern matching allows you to destructure and match against data structures.

### 3. Traits
Rust's trait system enables zero-cost abstractions and polymorphism.

### 4. Error Handling
Rust uses `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>` types for explicit error handling without exceptions.

## Getting Started

To install Rust, visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) and follow the instructions for your operating system.

After installation, verify by running:
```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

## Your First Rust Program

Create a new file called `main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Welcome to Rust!");
}
```

Compile and run:
```bash
rustc main.rs
./main
```

Or use Cargo (recommended):
```bash
cargo new hello_rust
cd hello_rust
cargo run
```

## Rust Philosophy

Rust follows these core principles:

1. **Zero-cost abstractions**: What you don't use, you don't pay for
2. **Memory safety**: No null pointer dereferences, no data races
3. **Threads without data races**: Fearless concurrency
4. **Trait-based generics**: Flexible and reusable code
5. **Pattern matching**: Expressive control flow
6. **Type inference**: Less boilerplate, more clarity
7. **Minimal runtime**: No garbage collector needed

## Common Use Cases

- Systems programming (OS, embedded systems)
- Web servers and network services
- Command-line tools
- WebAssembly applications
- Game engines
- Blockchain and cryptocurrencies
- Performance-critical applications
