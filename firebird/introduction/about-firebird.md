# About Firebird

Firebird is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that offers enterprise-level features with zero licensing costs. Originally derived from Borland's InterBase, Firebird has evolved into a mature, feature-rich database system used in production environments worldwide.

## What is Firebird?

Firebird is a SQL-compliant relational database that provides:
- Full ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- Multi-generational Architecture (MGA) for excellent concurrency
- True open-source licensing with no dual licensing or commercial versions
- Small footprint with powerful capabilities

## Key Features

### Cross-Platform Support
- Runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, and various UNIX platforms
- Consistent behavior across all platforms
- Same database file format on all platforms (with ODS compatibility)

### Architecture Options
- **Classic Server**: Process per connection, ideal for few users with heavy queries
- **SuperServer**: Single process with threads, better for many users
- **SuperClassic**: Hybrid approach combining benefits of both
- **Embedded**: Zero-administration, in-process database engine

### Advanced Database Features
- **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**: Readers don't block writers
- **Stored Procedures and Triggers**: Powerful PSQL procedural language
- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: Extend functionality with external libraries
- **Events and Monitoring**: Database events and monitoring tables
- **Full Text Search**: Built-in text search capabilities (Firebird 4.0+)
- **Window Functions**: Advanced analytical queries support

### SQL Standards Compliance
- ANSI SQL-92 entry level conformance
- Many SQL:2003 and SQL:2008 features
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Recursive queries
- MERGE statement
- Window (analytical) functions

### Enterprise Features
- **Backup/Restore**: Online backup without stopping the database
- **Two-Phase Commit**: Distributed transaction support
- **Role-Based Security**: Sophisticated security model
- **Encryption**: Database and network encryption support
- **International Character Sets**: Full Unicode support
